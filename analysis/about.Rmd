## Project Description

This project investigates long-range familial search capabilities in genetic databases. Using statistical models of fertility and family structure, we estimate how likely it is to identify individuals through their distant relatives (cousins) who may be present in genetic databases.

## Methods

### Fertility Modeling

We use a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution to model fertility patterns:

$$P(X = k) = \begin{cases}
\pi + (1 - \pi) \cdot NB(0; \mu, \theta) & \text{if } k = 0 \\
(1 - \pi) \cdot NB(k; \mu, \theta) & \text{if } k > 0
\end{cases}$$

where:
- $\pi$ is the zero-inflation probability (excess childlessness)
- $\mu$ is the mean of the negative binomial component
- $\theta$ is the dispersion parameter

### Sibling Distribution

The sibling distribution is derived from the fertility distribution, using the relationship: $$P(num_{sib}=k) \propto (k+1)P(num_{child}=k+1).$$

### Genetic Match Probability

The probability of a genetic match is modelled based on a binomial distribution $\text{Binomial}(r, cp)$, where $r$ is the number of cousins, $c$ is the database coverage, and $p$ is the genetic match probability.
